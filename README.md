# Text Category Classification

### Business Problem Context

###  Data analysis and modelling assignment

- Consider yourself a Data Scientist in Utopia Analytics, where we create models for user content classification based on customers' data.

- You are provided with files that contain the same data set in compressed JSONLines (data.jsonl.gz) and CSV (data.csv.gz) formats.

- The classification task is to predict the label (A or B) based on a sparse feature vector (fields x01 - xNN).

- In addition, the data set includes metadata for each row: author (the one who produces inputs), annotator (people giving the label), and timestamp.

- Process and analyze the provided data in terminal, Python, or with other tools.

- Try to get results quickly, but be ready to provide more accurate results.

###  Task 1

- Implement and train a classifier that predicts the label from the features.

- Use as quick and simple an approach as possible, but mention some ways to improve it.

- Report the results using some appropriate scores.

- Provide also the program code for your implementation.

###  Task 2

- Explore the data in whatever tools you are proficient with (Python/Pandas, R, Excel, etc.) and try to find issues that may impair the classification accuracy.

- Report what you found and how (you can include e.g. screenshots, tables, plots, and code).

- If you have any remaining ideas that you did not have time to test, mention those.

###  Task 3

- Try to fix at least one of the issues you found in Task 2 from the data

- Repeat the classification task

- Analyse and report the effect on the results.
